## Description
Web application designed using React. This web application allows you to connect your phantom wallet(for solana), which you will need to do in order to watch the gif stored already. Then, you have the opportunity to upload your own gif into the solana blockchain for a modest fee. The web application also counts with social media connectivity. Rust was used for backend and programming with solana.

## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
